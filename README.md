## VGG-16 Model

### Overview

The VGG-16 model is a deep neural network architecture developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.

### Architecture

The VGG-16 architecture consists of 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. It employs small 3x3 convolutional filters and 2x2 max-pooling layers with a stride of 2.

### Usage

The VGG-16 model can be easily accessed and used in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras for image classification, feature extraction, and transfer learning.
